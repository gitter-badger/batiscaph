This project should provide convenient visual interface to examine trace results in erlang code.

Particularly to illustrate traces for some code examples in [Learn you some Erlang](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/content) and [Programming Erlang](https://pragprog.com/book/jaerlang2/programming-erlang) books.

You need to install babel to use web interface:

    npm install .
